# audio-splitter
Tool to split audio files, currently beign used through a telegram bot.

I made the script `aduioSplitter` to split recordings of my band rehearsals, this is why currently Im not paying too much attention to all the border cases that can be found on it, although most are catch by `ffmpeg`. Im using a telegram bot as a provisional platform to use the script for my band mates.

A more detailed description is coming soon.
