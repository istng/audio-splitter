# av-splitter
Tool to easily split audio or video files.

I made the script `avSplitter` to split recordings of my band rehearsals. The script currently uses `ffmpeg` to manipulate the audio or video file. For now the usage is by command line only, but in the near future I will be implementing a UI for Linux and hopefully Windows.

A more detailed description is coming soon!
